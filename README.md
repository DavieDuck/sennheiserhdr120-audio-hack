Sennheiser HDR 120ll headphone transmitter automatically shuts off after 5 minutes of silence, causing the cordless headphones to blast loud static into the user's ears. This is an Adobe Air app that, with the help of a line in-out cable from an output jack to input jack, detects a period of silence on the sound output and plays a non-frightening sound. This is a complete hackjob, but for the past year it's virtually eradicated the unexpected blasts of static and made the headphones acceptably useable. If anybody's interested, it would be great to reprogram it so that it doesn't need the lineout cable, or just improve it some other way.

Features: 

- Detects when audio output has been silent for too long, and plays gentle sound that resets the transmitter's timer to shut off. 

- Designed to function with minimal interaction. Set it to run on Windows startup, and it minimizes to system tray, out of sight.


Hope this helps. I've read complaints about these kinds of headphones going all the way back to 2007, and I figured maybe this could help somebody out there.
